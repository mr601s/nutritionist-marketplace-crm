      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ”¥ Basal Metabolic Rate &amp; Energy Expenditure</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Let's start with your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)â€”this is the amount of energy (calories) your body needs just to keep you alive and functioning while at rest.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Think of it as the baseline: the calories your body burns to keep your heart beating, lungs breathing, and cells doing their thingâ€”even if you stayed in bed all day.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Your BMR is measured in calories per day, and it's influenced by several factors. One of the biggest? Muscle mass. If you have more muscle, your body burns more calories at restâ€”even if your weight is the same as someone else's. Why? Because muscle tissue is metabolically active and requires more energy to maintain than fat tissue.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          So if you and someone else have the same height and weight, but you've got more lean muscle, you'll naturally burn more calories just by existing. That's a win for your metabolism.
        </p>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ§¬ What Else Affects Your BMR?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Besides muscle mass, your BMR is also shaped by:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Gender: Men tend to have more muscle mass than women, which usually means a higher BMR.</li>
          <li>Age: As you get older, muscle mass tends to declineâ€”so BMR often drops too.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          But again, muscle mass is the key player here. The more you preserve or build muscle, the more you support your metabolism.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ§© BMR Is Just One Piece of the Puzzle</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Your BMR makes up a big chunkâ€”about 60%â€”of your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). But it's not the whole story. To understand how many calories your body burns in a day, you also need to factor in:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Your gender, age, height, and weight</li>
          <li>How much you move (non-exercise activity like walking, cleaning, fidgeting)</li>
          <li>How much you exercise (structured workouts or sports)</li>
          <li>The thermic effect of food (calories burned digesting and absorbing food)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The more active you areâ€”whether through workouts or just daily movementâ€”the higher your TDEE. Even small things like standing more or taking the stairs can add up.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          And yes, even digestion burns calories. That's the thermic effect of food, and it varies depending on what and how much you eat.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ§  Why This Matters for Fat Loss</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To lose fat, you need to understand how much energy your body usesâ€”and how you can influence it. Your TDEE gives you a personalized estimate of how many calories you burn each day. From there, you can adjust your intake and activity to create a calorie deficit (burning more than you consume), which is key for fat loss.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Here's the empowering part:</p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">You can influence your energy expenditure by:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Moving more throughout the day</li>
          <li>Exercising regularly</li>
          <li>Eating in a way that supports metabolism</li>
          <li>Building or maintaining muscle mass</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Your metabolism isn't fixedâ€”it's adaptable. And understanding your BMR and TDEE gives you the tools to work with your body, not against it.
