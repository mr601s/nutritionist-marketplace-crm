        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üß† Why Do We Gain Fat?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Let&apos;s break it down simply: body fat is your body&apos;s way of storing energy. That&apos;s its core job. When you eat more energy (calories) than your body needs, it doesn&apos;t just disappear‚Äîit gets stored. And that storage? It&apos;s fat.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          From an evolutionary perspective, this was a survival superpower. Back when food wasn&apos;t always available, your body needed a way to save up extra energy for the lean times. Fat storage made that possible.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">‚öñÔ∏è The Calorie Balance Equation</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Your body has a unique number of calories it needs each day to maintain your current weight. This includes your BMR (the energy you burn at rest) plus everything else‚Äîmovement, exercise, digestion, etc.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>If you consistently eat more than your body needs, it stores the extra.</li>
          <li>If you consistently eat less, your body taps into those stored reserves (fat) for energy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          So while there are lots of theories out there about weight gain, the most fundamental reason is this:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
          Calories in vs. calories out. That&apos;s the core of fat gain.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üõ°Ô∏è But Fat Isn&apos;t the Enemy</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Here&apos;s something important: body fat isn&apos;t bad. In fact, it&apos;s essential. Losing all your fat isn&apos;t the goal‚Äîand it wouldn&apos;t be healthy.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Your body fat plays several key roles:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Regulates your body temperature</li>
          <li>Protects your organs, bones, and muscles</li>
          <li>Stores hormones that help control hunger, appetite, and other vital functions</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          So yes, fat is energy storage‚Äîbut it&apos;s also a functional, protective part of your physiology. The goal isn&apos;t to lose as much as possible. It&apos;s to find a healthy balance that supports your body and your goals.
