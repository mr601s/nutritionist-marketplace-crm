        <p className="mb-4">
          Let&apos;s be honest‚Äîlosing fat isn&apos;t just about knowing the science. It&apos;s about applying it consistently, day after day, in real life. And real life? It&apos;s full of curveballs.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Yes, calories in vs. calories out is the foundation of fat loss. But sticking to a calorie deficit over time takes more than just willpower‚Äîit takes strategy, awareness, and support. Let&apos;s look at some of the most common roadblocks that can slow down or stall your progress.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üò¥ Sleep: The Underrated Fat Loss Tool</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Sleep isn&apos;t just rest‚Äîit&apos;s metabolic recovery. While you sleep, your body repairs itself, balances hormones, and resets your appetite signals. Without enough quality sleep, things start to unravel:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Hunger hormones like ghrelin (which increases appetite) and leptin (which signals fullness) get thrown off.</li>
          <li>You&apos;re more likely to crave high-calorie comfort foods.</li>
          <li>Motivation to move or exercise drops.</li>
          <li>Your body burns less fat‚Äîeven if you&apos;re in a calorie deficit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In fact, a 2011 study showed that people who slept just 5.5 hours per night lost significantly less fat than those who slept 8.5 hours‚Äîeven though both groups were dieting.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          So if you&apos;re serious about fat loss, prioritize sleep. It&apos;s not optional‚Äîit&apos;s essential.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üò´ Stress: The Silent Saboteur</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Chronic stress doesn&apos;t just mess with your mood‚Äîit messes with your metabolism. When stress is high, your body pumps out cortisol, a hormone that:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Encourages fat storage (especially around the belly)</li>
          <li>Disrupts sleep</li>
          <li>Increases cravings and emotional eating</li>
          <li>Makes it harder to stick to healthy habits</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Stress also makes you more likely to reach for quick fixes‚Äîlike sugary snacks or skipping workouts. And when stress affects sleep, it creates a vicious cycle that can derail your progress.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Managing stress through movement, mindfulness, and relaxation isn&apos;t just good for your mental health‚Äîit&apos;s a direct investment in your fat loss success.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">üçø Mindless Eating: The Sneaky Calorie Creep</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Unconscious snacking is one of the fastest ways to sabotage a calorie deficit. A handful of chips here, a few sips of a sugary drink there‚Äîit all adds up. And because it&apos;s not tracked or intentional, it&apos;s easy to underestimate how much you&apos;re actually consuming.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Here&apos;s how to stay ahead of it:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Keep a food journal to stay aware of what you&apos;re eating</li>
          <li>Prep meals and snacks so you&apos;re not relying on impulse</li>
          <li>Limit exposure to tempting foods (out of sight, out of mind)</li>
          <li>Practice mindful eating‚Äîslow down, taste your food, and tune into hunger cues</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Being intentional with your choices helps you stay in control‚Äîand dramatically increases your chances of reaching your goals.
