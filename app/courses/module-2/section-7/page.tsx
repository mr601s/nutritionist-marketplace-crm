        Once you{'ve'} set your calorie deficit and macronutrient targets, the next step is to track your progress and make adjustments as needed. This isn{'t'} a {"set it and forget it"} process‚Äîyour body will change, and your plan should evolve with it.

        ‚öñÔ∏è How to Track Your True Weight
      </h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        To get an accurate picture of your weight trend:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Weigh yourself every morning, right after using the bathroom, before eating, and without clothes</li>
        <li>Keep the scale in the same spot each day to avoid fluctuations from uneven surfaces</li>
        <li>At the end of the week, add up all 7 weigh-ins and divide by 7 to get your weekly average</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        This average gives you a clearer view than a single weigh-in, which can be affected by water retention, digestion, or sleep.

        üîß When to Adjust Your Calories
      </h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Use your weekly average to guide your next move:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Lost 1‚Äì2 lbs? Great‚Äîno changes needed</li>
        <li>Lost 0.1‚Äì0.5 lbs? Reduce calories by up to 200/day</li>
        <li>Gained weight? Reduce calories by up to 300/day</li>
        <li>Lost more than 2‚Äì3 lbs? If you{'re'} not overweight or obese, increase calories by up to 200/day to slow the pace</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
        ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        In the first week, you might drop 5‚Äì7 lbs. That{'s'} mostly water and food weight, not just fat. So wait until week two before making any adjustments.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        Also, when reducing calories, cut mostly from carbs, then fat‚Äîbut never from protein. Protein is essential for preserving muscle and keeping your metabolism strong.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong>BONUS:</strong> I{'ve'} included a tracking worksheet if you want to also track your body composition. For women: use all 4 measurements. For men: measure just your waist and hips.
