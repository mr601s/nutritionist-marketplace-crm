        ü•ó 2.6 Food Choices
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
        Calories matter‚Äîbut what you eat matters too. The types of foods you choose can influence your hunger, energy levels, nutrient intake, and how well your body responds to a calorie deficit.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
        One key concept to understand is <strong>bioavailability</strong>‚Äîhow well your body absorbs and uses the nutrients in food. Some foods are more bioavailable than others, meaning your body can extract and use their nutrients more efficiently.

        üçñ Animal vs. Plant-Based Protein Sources
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Animal-based foods like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy tend to have high bioavailability and contain all 9 essential amino acids, making them complete proteins. They{"'re"} also highly satiating, which helps you feel full longer‚Äîespecially helpful during fat loss.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        But here{"'s"} the important part:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>Vegetarians and vegans can absolutely meet their protein needs.</li>
        <li>While most plant-based proteins are incomplete (missing one or more essential amino acids), combining different sources‚Äîlike legumes + grains or nuts + seeds‚Äîcan create a complete amino acid profile. Foods like soy, quinoa, lentils, tempeh, and pea protein are especially powerful options. Also, eating a variety of amino acids throughout the day can lead to the body getting what it needs so the idea of having to create complete proteins has been debunked!</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Plant-based diets also offer:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>High fiber for digestion and fullness</li>
        <li>Lower calorie density for volume eating</li>
        <li>A wide range of vitamins and minerals</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
        ü•ë Striking the Right Balance
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Whether you eat animal products or not, the goal is the same: <strong>Build your meals around nutrient-dense, whole foods that support your goals and keep you satisfied.</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Here{"'s"} a sample list of top foods to include in a weight loss plan:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>Grass-fed beef or organs (if omnivorous)</li>
        <li>Salmon, tuna, or other fatty fish</li>
        <li>Free-range eggs and dairy (if included)</li>
        <li>Avocados</li>
        <li>Nuts and seeds</li>
        <li>Beans and legumes</li>
        <li>Soy products (tofu, tempeh, edamame)</li>
        <li>Quinoa and whole grains</li>
        <li>A variety of fruits</li>
        <li>A variety of vegetables</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
        Whether you{"'re"} omnivorous, vegetarian, or vegan, the key is <strong>variety and intentionality</strong>. Mix and match foods that support your protein, fiber, and micronutrient needs.

        üçü What About Processed Foods?
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Let{"'s"} talk about the elephant in the pantry: junk food. Do you have to give it up completely to lose weight?
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Not necessarily.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Processed foods‚Äîlike chips, cookies, and sugary snacks‚Äîoften contain trans fats, additives, and low-quality ingredients. But here{"'s"} the truth: <strong>The dose makes the poison.</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        If your overall diet is built around whole, nutrient-dense foods, having a small portion of processed foods won{"'t"} derail your progress. In fact, allowing some flexibility can help you:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>Maintain a healthier relationship with food</li>
        <li>Reduce cravings and binge tendencies</li>
        <li>Stay consistent long-term</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        When you completely restrict certain foods, they often become {"\"forbidden,\""} which makes them feel more special‚Äîand more tempting. That can lead to overindulgence when you finally give in.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Instead, include them strategically and mindfully:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>Enjoy small portions without guilt</li>
        <li>Don{"'t"} rely on them as staples</li>
        <li>Keep the majority of your intake focused on whole foods</li>
      </ul>
