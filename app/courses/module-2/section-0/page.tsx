        <p className="mb-4">
          Before you can build a smart fat loss plan, you need to know how many calories your body burns in a day. That number is called your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)â€”and it&apos;s your starting point.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Your TDEE includes:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)â€”the calories you burn at rest</li>
          <li>Plus everything else: movement, workouts, digestion, and lifestyle habits</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Knowing your TDEE helps you figure out how many calories you need to maintain your current weight. From there, you can adjust your intake to create a deficit and lose fat.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ§® A Simple Way to Estimate TDEE</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You can use online calculators for a more detailed estimate, but here&apos;s a quick formula:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Multiply your body weight (in pounds) by:</li>
          <li>12 if you&apos;re mostly sedentary</li>
          <li>13 if you exercise 2â€“3 times per week</li>
          <li>14â€“15 if you exercise 3â€“6 times per week</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">Example:</p>
        <p className="mb-4 ml-4">
          If you weigh 200 lbs and work out 2â€“3 times a week:<br />
          200 Ã— 13 = 2600 calories/day for maintenance
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This is just a starting point. Your actual needs may vary based on metabolism, body composition, and lifestyle. That&apos;s why it&apos;s important to track progress and adjust as needed.

          BONUS: I have provided an additional handout (PDF) that contains a link to one of my favorite TDEE calculators- even easier than doing the math yourself!
