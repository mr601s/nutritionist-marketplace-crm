        Section 2.9: Frequently Asked Questions
      </h1>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        There{"'"}s no shortage of myths and confusion when it comes to weight loss. From {""} fat-burning foods{""} to artificial sweeteners, it{"'"}s easy to get overwhelmed. So let{"'"}s clear the air and tackle some of the most common questions‚Äîso you can move forward with clarity and confidence.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
        üßÅ Question 1: Are Artificial Sweeteners Bad?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This one{"'"}s been debated for years. But here{"'"}s what the science says:
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Artificial sweeteners aren{"'"}t inherently harmful‚Äîand they can actually help.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Studies show that swapping sugary drinks for zero-calorie sweeteners can:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Reduce overall calorie intake</li>
        <li>Support weight loss</li>
        <li>Improve blood sugar control (especially helpful for those with diabetes)</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">
        As with anything, moderation matters. But when used wisely, artificial sweeteners can be a useful tool in your fat loss journey‚Äînot a threat.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Myth busted.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
        üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Question 2: Is Cardio Mandatory?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Nope. You don{"'"}t have to do cardio to lose weight.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The only thing that{"'"}s truly required is a caloric deficit‚Äîeating fewer calories than your body burns.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        That said, exercise is highly recommended, especially strength training, which helps:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Preserve muscle mass</li>
        <li>Support metabolism</li>
        <li>Improve body composition</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Cardio can help you burn extra calories and reach your deficit more easily‚Äîbut it{"'"}s optional, not mandatory.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
        ü•ë Question 3: Which Foods Make You Lose Weight?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Despite the hype around {""} superfoods,{""} no single food can burn fat on its own.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Fat loss happens when your overall energy balance is in check.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        However, some foods can support fat loss by helping you feel full and satisfied. These include:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>High-protein foods (e.g., tofu, chicken, lentils)</li>
        <li>Healthy fats (e.g., avocado, nuts)</li>
        <li>Fiber-rich foods (e.g., vegetables, beans, whole grains)</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-8">
        These foods help control hunger and cravings, making it easier to stick to your plan.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
        üçΩÔ∏è Question 4: Does Meal Frequency Matter?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Not really. Whether you eat three meals a day or just one big meal, what matters most is:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Your total daily calories</li>
        <li>Your macronutrient balance</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Choose a meal frequency that fits your lifestyle and helps you stay consistent. Some people thrive on three structured meals, while others prefer fewer, larger meals. There{"'"}s no one-size-fits-all answer‚Äîjust what works for you.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Please Note: For many who experience higher cortisol levels, however, eating within the first hour of waking, can be ideal - although most experience less appetite at this time of day due to the elevated cortisol.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
        üíä Question 5: Do Supplements Matter?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Supplements are not the foundation of fat loss. The real pillars are:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Nutrition</li>
        <li>Movement</li>
        <li>Sleep</li>
        <li>Stress management</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        That said, some supplements can be helpful:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Protein powder: Great for hitting protein targets, especially if you{"'"}re plant-based or on the go</li>
        <li>Creatine: Supports strength and performance</li>
        <li>Caffeine: Boosts energy and focus, especially during a calorie deficit</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Use supplements to support your plan‚Äînot replace it. They{"'"}re the cherry on top, not the whole sundae.
      </p>
