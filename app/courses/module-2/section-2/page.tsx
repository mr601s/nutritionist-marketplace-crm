          Once {"you've"} set your calorie goal, {"it's"} time to break those calories down into macronutrients‚Äîstarting with protein.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Protein is the most important nutrient during fat loss because it:

        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
          <li>Preserves muscle mass</li>
          <li>Keeps you feeling full</li>

        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Your body {"can't"} make essential amino acids on its own, so you need to get them from food. {"That's"} why protein is non-negotiable.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Aim for <strong>1 gram of protein per pound of body weight</strong>.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Example:</strong> If you weigh 200 lbs, your target is 200 grams of protein/day.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          That gives you 800 calories from protein (since protein has 4 calories per gram).

          Getting enough protein helps you stay strong, energized, and metabolically active‚Äîeven in a deficit.
