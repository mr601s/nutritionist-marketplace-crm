        <p className="mb-4">
          Once you{"'"} ve estimated your TDEE, the next step is to create a caloric deficitâ€”meaning you eat fewer calories than your body burns. That{"'"} s how fat loss happens.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When you{"'"} re in a deficit, your body taps into stored fat for energy. Over time, this leads to weight loss.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ”§ How Much Should You Cut?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A safe and effective deficit is usually 400â€“500 calories below your TDEE. This typically results in a weight loss of 1â€“2 pounds per week, which is sustainable and healthy.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you{"'"} re starting with more body fat, you may lose weight faster at firstâ€”up to 4â€“5 pounds per weekâ€”without harming your health. As your body composition improves, that rate will naturally slow down.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ“Š Monitor &amp; Adjust</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Your initial estimate is just thatâ€”an estimate. Track your weight weekly and adjust your intake if needed. If you{"'"} re losing too fast or too slow, tweak your calories slightly.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          And remember: rapid weight loss often leads to rapid regain. The goal is steady, sustainable progressâ€”not extremes.
